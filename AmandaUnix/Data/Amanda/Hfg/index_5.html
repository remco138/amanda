<A NAME="page_311"></A><HR><H2>basic types</H2>
<BR>
The basic types are:
<PRE>
num     || both integer and real
bool    || with only values True, False
char    || ascii set
</PRE>
<BR>

<A NAME="page_312"></A><HR><H2>list types</H2>
<BR>
List types are denoted by:
<BR>
[ &lttypeName&gt ]
<BR>

<A NAME="page_313"></A><HR><H2>tuple types</H2>
<BR>
Tuple types are denoted by:
<BR>
()
<BR>
( &lttypeName&gt, &lttypeName&gt, ... &lttypeName&gt )
<BR>
<BR>
The first form defines an empty tuple type. The only possible value of
this type is () the empty tuple.
<BR>
Of course (for syntactical reasons) unary tuples are not available.
<BR>

<A NAME="page_314"></A><HR><H2>algebraic types</H2>
<BR>
Concrete algebraic types can be defined like:
<BR>
<BR>
Example:
<BR>
numTree ::= Leaf num | Branch numTree numTree
<BR>
<BR>
Example:
<BR>
tree (*) ::= Leaf (*) | Branch (tree (*)) (tree (*))
<BR>
<BR>
With (*) a polymorphic typevariable is denoted.
<BR>
The parentheses around (*) are not strictly necessary,
so one may write:
<BR>
tree * ::= Leaf * | Branch (tree *) (tree *)
<BR>
<BR>
NB: the ordering of the elements of a concrete type is undefined, though
equality tests are perfectly valid.
<BR>

<A NAME="page_315"></A><HR><H2>record types</H2>
<BR>
Record types are defined as in the following example:
<BR>
<BR>
vector * ::= { x :: *, y :: *, z :: * }
<BR>
<BR>
For every field a selector function is defined like:
<BR>
x { x=xr, y=yr, z=zr } = xr
<BR>
<BR>
The drawback of this construction is that all field names of all record types
must be different.
<BR>
<BR>
A constant record can be denoted like:
<BR>
{ x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }
<BR>
{ y = 100, z = 20 }
<BR>
<BR>
From the last example it is obvious that partial records can be defined. Of course
the omitted fields should never be accessed.
<BR>
Empty records are not available (what could be their use ?)
<BR>
Partial records are useful for pattern matching and for updates.
<BR>
<BR>
Functions on records can be defined using the field access functions:
<BR>
innerproduct r1 r2 = x r1 * x r2 + y r1 * y r2 + z r1 * z r2
<BR>
<BR>
or using patterns:
<BR>
innerproduct { x=x1, y=y1, z=z1 } { x=x2, y=y2, z=z2 } = x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2
<BR>
<BR>
The operator & is used to update a record with information from another record:
<PRE>
clearx r = r & { x = 0 }
doublex (r = { x = xr }) = r & { x = 2 * xr }
</PRE>
In the function double the argument is called r and its field x is called xr and
the result is r with its field x changed to twice its original value. The result
of course is a copy of the record r with a new value for field x.
<BR>

<A NAME="page_316"></A><HR><H2>type synonyms</H2>
<BR>
Typesynonyms are denoted like:
<BR>
<BR>
string == [char]
<BR>
<BR>
complex == (num, num)
<BR>
<BR>
point * == (*, *)
<BR>

<A NAME="page_317"></A><HR><H2>abstract types</H2>
<BR>
Abstract types are denoted like:
<PRE>
abstype stack *
with
  push    :: * -&gt stack * -&gt stack *
  pop     :: stack * -&gt stack *
  top     :: stack * -&gt *
  isEmpty :: stack * -&gt bool
  create  :: stack *

stack * == [*]

push x s  = x:s
pop (x:s) = s
top (x:s) = x
isEmpty s = s = []
create    = []
</PRE>
An abstract type hides the implementation. This means that only the functions
belonging to the abstract type may use the implementation details.
<BR>
In the example push uses the list constructor, which is correct because stack *
is defined as a list and push belongs to the abstract type.
<BR>
But functions outside the abstract type may only use push to add something on a stack.
<BR>
<BR>
NB: an abstract type must be a synonym of another type.
<BR>

<A NAME="page_318"></A><HR><H2>generic functions</H2>
<BR>
Like abstract types generic functions are a feature of the typechecker.
<BR>
<BR>
Usually polymorphism means structural polymorphism like in:
<PRE>
hd :: [*] -&gt *
hd (x:_) = x
</PRE>
The polymorphism of the function ?= (equality test) is of a different kind
because it is defined differently for different types. Although in all cases
the type conforms with its generic type.
<BR>
<BR>
We could define ?= for some cases like:
<PRE>
generic ?= :: * -&gt * -&gt bool

([]      ?= []     ) = True
(x:xs    ?= y:ys   ) = x ?= y /\ xs ?= ys
(True    ?= True   ) = True
(False   ?= False  ) = True
((x1,y1) ?= (x2,y2)) = x1 ?= x2 /\ y1 ?= y2
...
(_ ?= _) = False   || default unequal
</PRE>
The keyword generic indicates that the function could be defined for
different cases all conforming to the specified generic type scheme.
<BR>
<BR>
Example:
<PRE>
generic print :: * -&gt [char]

print (x = num)  = ftoa x
print True       = "True"
print False      = "False"
print (c = char) = [c]
print []         = "[]"
print (x:xs)     = "[" ++ print x ++ concat[", " ++ print y | y &lt- xs] ++ "]"
print (x, y)     = "(" ++ print x ++ ", " ++ print y ++ ")"
...
</PRE>
The pattern (x = num) means that x is an alias for an element of type num.
Only the basic types num, bool and char may be used as patterns.
<BR>
<BR>
NB: because the type checking regime for generic functions is weaker than for
normal functions, generic functions should be used with care.
<BR>
<BR>
See
<A HREF="#page_319">type checking</A>
for a more elaborate explication of the type inference process
<BR>

<A NAME="page_319"></A><HR><H2>type checking</H2>
<BR>
The task of the type checker is to ensure that on run time "things can't go wrong".
Of course infinite loops, division by zero or failing patterns are in general not
detectable on compile time. But checking that a function is called with the
correct number and type of arguments is feasible.
<BR>
<BR>
The type checker generally does the following things:
<BR>
- it substitutes all occurrences of type synonyms
<BR>
- it ensures that the definitions of abstract types are only visible for
the functions belonging to it
<BR>
- it finds and checks all the types of normal functions
<BR>
- it checks the types of generic functions
<BR>
<BR>
Example:
<PRE>
f [] = 0
f (x:xs) = add x (f xs)

add x y = x + y
</PRE>
The type inference goes like this.
<BR>
<BR>
Firstly the most general assumptions on the types are made:
<BR>
f   :: *
<BR>
add :: *
<BR>
<BR>
From the first clause of f is deduced:
<BR>
f :: [*] -&gt num
<BR>
From the second clause of f is deduced (using the known types of f and add):
<BR>
f :: [*] -&gt **
<BR>
The function should comply to both types so the types are "unified" giving:
<BR>
f :: [*] -&gt num
<BR>
<BR>
The same thing is done for the function add giving:
<BR>
add :: num -&gt num -&gt num
<BR>
<BR>
Because the type of add has changed the second clause of the function f should be
considered again giving:
<BR>
f :: [num] -&gt num
<BR>
<BR>
This process is repeated until all types are stable.
<BR>
If the programmer has provided types for functions these are taken as a starting point.
In that way the programmer can restrict the type of a function.
<BR>
<BR>
The repeated approximation of the types makes polymorphism possible.
So a strange function like the following is correctly typed:
<PRE>
f x 0 = x
f x n = x ,if f 1 0 = 1 \/ f [1] 1 = [1]
</PRE>
For local definitions in a where clause a more rigid scheme is used. All
occurrences of such a definition share the same type. This excludes polymorphism,
but speeds up the type inference process and rarely gives problems because
polymorphic functions are usually shared by many functions and are thus global.
<BR>
<BR>
The types of generic functions are provided by the programmer so at first
sight the type checker only needs to check if all the clauses conform to
this given type.
<BR>
<BR>
But examples like the following show that this is not desirable:
<PRE>
generic f :: num -&gt *

f 0 = 'a'
f 1 = 1

generic g :: [*] -&gt (*, **)

g [1] = (0, 0)
g []  = ('a', 'a')
</PRE>
Expressions like [f 0, f 1] and [g [], g [1]] are now going wrong.
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is caused by the occurrence of a new type variable in the result.
So this is not allowed.
<BR>
A similar thing may happen at run time if the patterns of function clauses
are not tight enough.
<BR>
<BR>
Example:
<PRE>
generic print :: * -&gt [char]

print [] = "[]"
print (x:xs) = "[" ++ print x ++ concat[", " ++ print x | x &lt- xs] ++ "]"
print n = ftoa n
print c = [c]
</PRE>
The clauses have the following types:
<PRE>
[*] -&gt [char]
[*] -&gt [char]
num -&gt [char]
*   -&gt [*]          (becomes char -&gt [char] after unification)
</PRE>
They can all be unified with the generic type scheme.
<BR>
But the call (print 'a') goes wrong because the third clause will be used.
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is caused by the fact that at run time the input determines which
clause is activated but the type is also determined by the output.
The pattern of the third clause is too weak to ensure that only numbers are plugged in.
Likewise the pattern of the fourth clause is too weak.
<BR>
<BR>
For a clause of a generic function the type checker at first deduces a type
based on the given input patterns and unifies this with the generic type scheme
giving the actual type. Then the type of the result is found and unified with it.
If new constraints are found the clause is rejected.
<BR>
<BR>
For the third clause (print n = ftoa n) the actual type based on the input is:
<BR>
* -&gt [char]
<BR>
but the result leads to the type
<BR>
num -&gt [char]
<BR>
So the result imposes extra constraints and the clause is rejected.
<BR>
<BR>
The programmer should change the clause to:
<BR>
print (n = num) = ftoa n
